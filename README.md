# Pokemon Card Ebay Price Evaluator - Critical Hit Collectables

This repository contains the built packages for both MACARM64 and WINDOWS. Simply type the name of the card in the name field (Charizard).

Next type the card number in the card number field (185/165)

Select your other options. Do not forget if you are in the UK you should keep it selected at UK since if you are trying to get a market valuation worldwide (USA) has higher sales value and vendors will not pay this.

Know the percentage your vendor pays? Simply add the percentage in and you can get an idea of what you will be paid out.

You will notice you can filter the amount of listings too, by default ebay shows 60 listings and this is generally usually fine for finding the last 30 days of sales but sometimes you may need to adjust if that card has had volume in sales.

You will see 4 prices:

### Low
This is the lowest priced sale on ebays sold listings


### Average
This is considered the true market value of ebay sold lsitings.


### High
These unfortunate souls who paid too high are either hoping for a price increase OR are the first people to get it at the value of the rising market price.


## Is it only for the cards?

No, infact you can ignore the card number field and search for example "Topps charizard" (or add its number also).


## Donations

You will notice a donations paypal address has been added to the bottom, this is not mandatory. Server costs and time spent can be costly so thank you if you decide to donate for my time!
